# My personal website

This repository contains all of the code that was used to create my personal website. 

### My website contains four tabs: Home, Bio, Blog Posts, and Resume. 

**Home** – Everything in the home tab exists in the index.qml file at the root directory

**Bio** – My bio is in the about.qmd file in the root directory

**Blog Posts** – In the posts folder in the root directory, there are additional folders for each blog post I have written. In these subfolders, the index.qmd file contains the code required to make the blog. 

**Resume** – My resume is in the Resume.pdf file in the root directory
