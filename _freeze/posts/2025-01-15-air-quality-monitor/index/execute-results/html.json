While we ran into the typical hurdles that come with rural data collection, such as patchy network connectivity and occasional data gaps, our initial results give us some valuable insights into the area’s air quality.\n\nThe fleet of monitors recorded an average daily fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) concentration of about 49 μg/m³—a level higher than the World Health Organization’s primary PM 2.5 target of 5 μg/m3 and interim target of 35 μg/m3. We also saw clear daily spikes in pollution during cooking hours (morning and evening) and a large jump in overall pollution during the Harmattan season, a period roughly from late-November to mid-March when a cool dry wind blows dust from the Sahara over much of West Africa.\n\nElevated levels of particulate matter can significantly influence both maternal health and early childhood development \\[1\\]\\[2\\]. The measurements shared in this report highlight the scale of this issue in Ghana’s rural farming regions and smaller urban centers, informing future epidemiological studies of air pollution risk.\n\n## Monitors\n\nFor data collection, we used QuantAQ’s ModulairPM and Modulair devices. Before installing them in each community, we colocated the monitors at the Kintampo Health Research Center (KHRC) to cross-check and adjust for any systematic biases between the units. These initial calibrations ensure consistent, high-quality data across all 40 locations. After the colocation period, we deployed the monitors to their respective communities. The maps below illustrates their distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define the bounding box coordinates\nbbox_coords <- matrix(c(-2.2, 7.6, -2.2, 8.8, -1.3, 8.8, -1.3, 7.6, -2.2, 7.6), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\nbbox_polygon <- st_polygon(list(bbox_coords))\nbbox_sf <- st_sfc(bbox_polygon, crs = st_crs(4326))\n\n# Plot the map with the bounding box\nghana_full <- ggplot() +\n  # Add Ghana regions\n  geom_sf(data = regions, fill = ifelse(regions$region == \"Bono East\", \"#f5e493\", \"#dadbe0\"), color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Add monitor points with transparency\n  geom_sf(data = monitor_points, aes(geometry = geometry), color = \"red\", alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +\n  # Add bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = bbox_sf, fill = NA, color = \"blue\", lwd = 0.5, linetype = \"solid\") +\n  # Add Ghana country boundary\n  geom_sf(data = country, fill = NA, color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  #labs(title = \"Monitor Locations in Ghana\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11), # Increase axis text size\n    axis.ticks = element_line(size = 1), # Increase tick mark size\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16) \n  )\n\n\nzoomed_map <- ggplot() +\n  # Add Ghana regions within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = regions, fill = ifelse(regions$region == \"Bono East\", \"#f5e493\", \"#dadbe0\"), color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Add monitor points with transparency within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = monitor_points, aes(geometry = geometry, color = monitor_type), alpha = 0.5, size = 5) +\n  \n  # Add Kintampo marker\n  geom_sf(data = kintampo_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  # Add Dwenewoho marker\n  geom_sf(data = dwenewoho_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  # Add new longoro marker\n  geom_sf(data = new_longoro_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  # Add apesika marker\n  geom_sf(data = apesika_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  # Add kurawura akura marker\n  geom_sf(data = kurawura_akura_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  # Add Kintamp annotation text\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.73, y = 8.10, label = \"Kintampo\", color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  # Add Dwenewoho annotation text\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.69, y = 7.74, label = \"Dwenewoho\", color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  # Add new longoro annotation text\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -2.047, y = 8.214, label = \"New Longoro\", color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  # Add apesika annotation text\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.459, y = 7.96, label = \"Apesika\", color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  # Add atta akura annotation text\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -1.65, y = 8.75, label = \"Kurawura Akura\", color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  \n  # Zoom in to the bounding box\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-2.2, -1.3), ylim = c(7.6, 8.8), expand = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"\", \n       y = \"\",\n       color = \"Monitor Type\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11), # Increase axis text size\n    axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.5), # Increase tick mark size\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16), # Increase title size\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10), # Increase legend text size\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12) # Increase legend title size\n  )\n\n# Create a joint title\ntitle <- textGrob(\"Monitor Locations in Ghana\", gp = gpar(fontsize = 20))\n\n# Arrange plots with title\ngrid.arrange(\n  arrangeGrob(ghana_full, zoomed_map, ncol = 2),  # Arrange plots\n  top = title  # Add title at the top\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot monitor locations-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Air Quality Index (AQI) Context\n\nBefore diving into the results, I wanted to provide some context on air quality measurements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI) is a scale that measures pollution levels in the air. The scale is divided into six categories, with each associated with a different color and level of concern. While the final score is calculated using five major air pollutants—particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide—this analysis will focus on PM 2.5, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.\n\nThe table below shows the EPA's cutoffs \\[3\\] for each health concern category, including both the standard AQI values (the numbers commonly seen in air quality reports and weather apps) and the specific PM 2.5 concentration ranges that contribute to the index.\n\n| AQI Category and Index Value               | Corresponding fine particle (PM 2.5) Measurement (µg/m³) |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Good (0 – 50)                              | 0.0 to 9.0                                              |\n| Moderate (51 – 100)                        | 9.1 to 35.4                                             |\n| Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101 – 150) | 35.5 to 55.4                                            |\n| Unhealthy (151 – 200)                      | 55.5 to 125.4                                           |\n| Very Unhealthy (201 – 300)                 | 125.5 to 225.4                                          |\n| Hazardous (301+)                           | 225.5+                                                  |\n\n## Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### PM 2.5 Concentrations Over Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define AQI levels with ordered factors\naqi_levels <- data.frame(\n  ymin = c(0, 9.1, 35.5, 55.5, 125.5, 225.5),\n  ymax = c(9, 35.4, 55.4, 125.4, 225.4, 450),\n  fill = factor(c(\"Good\", \"Moderate\", \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\", \n                  \"Unhealthy\", \"Very Unhealthy\", \"Hazardous\"), \n                levels = c(\"Good\", \"Moderate\", \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\", \n                           \"Unhealthy\", \"Very Unhealthy\", \"Hazardous\")),\n  color = c(\"green\", \"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\", \"purple\", \"maroon\")\n)\n\n# Plot with legend inside the graph\ndaily_pollutants_long %>%\n  filter(pollutant == \"Mean PM 2.5\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = measurement)) +\n  # Add background rectangles for AQI levels\n  geom_rect(data = aqi_levels, \n            aes(xmin = min(daily_pollutants_long$date), \n                xmax = max(daily_pollutants_long$date), \n                ymin = ymin, \n                ymax = ymax, \n                fill = fill), \n            color = NA, alpha = 0.2, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  # Add the PM 2.5 line\n  geom_line(color = \"black\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Mean PM 2.5 Suggests Levels of Concern for Sensitive Groups Year Round \\nwith Unhealthy Air Quality for All During the Harmattan.\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = bquote(\"Fleet Mean \" ~ PM[2.5] ~ (µg/m^3)),\n       fill = \"US-EPA AQI Risk Categories\") +  # Add legend title for the AQI levels\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=20), # set title size \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16),   # Increase axis titles size\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),    # Increase axis labels size\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14),    # Increase facet group text size\n    legend.position = c(0.77, 0.73),  # Position legend inside the graph (top right)\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = rgb(1, 1, 1, alpha = 0.7), color = \"black\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 14),  # Adjust legend title size\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)    # Adjust legend text size\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = aqi_levels$color) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))  # Reverse the order of the legend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe figure above shows that PM 2.5 levels often exceed the 'good' to 'moderate' AQI range, particularly from December through February—roughly the Harmattan season.\n\nWe see similar trends for other sizes of particulate matter, as illustrated in the three-panel plot below. The first panel highlights PM1 concentrations (mean 37 µg/m³), the second panel shows PM 2.5 (mean 43.2 µg/m³), and the third panel displays PM10 (mean 101 µg/m³). All three exhibit noticeable peaks during the dry, dusty Harmattan months, suggesting that the same sources (such as windblown dust) drive increases across all particle sizes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndaily_pollutants_long %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = measurement)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_measurement), color = \"#cc1414\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(data = mean_values, aes(x = max(daily_pollutants_long$date), y = mean_measurement, label = paste0(pollutant, \": \", round(mean_measurement, 2), \" µg/m³\")),\n            color = \"#cc1414\", hjust = 1, vjust = -0.9, size = 4.5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Grand Averages Patterns Consistent Across Particle Sizes\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Pollutant Measurement (µg/m³)\") +\n  facet_grid(factor(pollutant, levels = c(\"Mean PM 1\", \"Mean PM 2.5\", \"Mean PM 10\" )) ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16),   # Increase axis titles size\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),    # Increase axis labels size\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14)  # Increase facet group text size\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Hourly PM 2.5 Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npm25_community_hourly <- pm25_community_hourly %>%\n    mutate(date = ymd(date))  # Use lubridate to ensure date conversion\n  \nheat_map_data <- pm25_community_hourly %>%\n    group_by(date, hour) %>%\n    summarize(mean_pm25 = mean(mean_pm25, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n    ungroup() %>%\n    mutate(day = day(date),\n           month = factor(format(date, \"%b\"), levels = c(\"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\", \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\")),\n           year = year(date)) %>%\n  mutate(log_mean_pm25 = log(mean_pm25))\n\n\nggplot(heat_map_data, aes(day, hour, fill = mean_pm25)) +\n    geom_tile(color = NA, size = 0) + \n    scale_fill_gradientn(\n        colors = c(\"#221f26\", \"#3f2363\", \"#872CA2\", \"#D44292\", \"#F98477\", \"#EDD9A1\", \"#fffceb\"), # Specify your custom colors\n        values = scales::rescale(c(0, 5, 12, 20, 40, 60, 100)), # Set breaks; adjust these values based on your data range\n        name = \"PM 2.5 \\n(µg/m³)\"\n    ) + \n    facet_grid(~month) +\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"reverse\", breaks = unique(heat_map_data$hour)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 15, 30)) +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n    labs(title = \"Heatmap Shows Strong Seasonal and Daily Patterns in PM 2.5\",\n         x = \"Day\",\n         y = \"Hour\") + \n    theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n          plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 0),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n          strip.background = element_rect(colour = \"white\"),\n          strip.text = element_text(size = 15),   # Increase facet group text size\n          axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n          axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n          legend.title = element_text(size = 14),\n          legend.text = element_text(size = 13),\n          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),\n          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),\n          panel.background = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe heatmap illustrates how both season and time of day affect PM 2.5 concentrations across all 40 monitors.

These spikes likely coincide with cooking and other daily activities that generate or stir up particulate matter. As the Harmattan subsides around March, average PM levels drop, and remain lower into the late spring and early summer months.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_plot <- pm25_community_hourly %>% \n  mutate(harmattan = ifelse(date >= harmattan_start & date <= harmattan_end, \"Harmattan\", \"Not Harmattan\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    cooking_period = factor(case_when(\n      hour >= 16 & hour <= 19 ~ \"Evening Cooking Hours\", #4-9pm\n      hour >= 5 & hour <= 8 ~ \"Morning Cooking Hours\", #5-9am\n      (hour < 16 | hour > 19) &  (hour < 5 | hour > 8) & hour != 3 ~ \"Other Hours\",\n      hour == 3 ~ \"Control Hour\"\n    ), levels = c(\"Evening Cooking Hours\", \"Morning Cooking Hours\", \"Control Hour\", \"Other Hours\"))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(hour)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = harmattan, y = mean_pm25, fill = cooking_period)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"PM 2.5 Concentration\", \n       x = \"Season\",\n       fill = \"Cooking\\nPeriod\") +  # Change legend title and add line breaks\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Evening Cooking Hours\" = \"goldenrod\", \n    \"Morning Cooking Hours\" = \"#7db569\", \n    \"Control Hour\" = \"#b672e0\",\n    \"Other Hours\" = \"#52b3eb\"\n  ),\n  labels = c(\"Evening Cooking Hours (4pm-8pm)\", \"Morning Cooking Hours (5am-9am)\", \"Control Hour (3am)\", \"Other Hours (Excluding Cooking \\nand Control Hours)\"))  # Add line breaks in legend labels\n\n\nbase_plot +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.72, xend = 0.90, y = 515, yend = 515), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0.81, y = 518, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.91, xend = 1.09, y = 515, yend = 515), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = 518, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.10, xend = 1.28, y = 515, yend = 515), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.19, y = 518, label = \"**\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.72, xend = 1.09, y = 525, yend = 525), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0.9, y = 529, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.91, xend = 1.27, y = 536, yend = 536), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.09, y = 540, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.72, xend = 1.27, y = 548, yend = 548), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = 552, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  \n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.72, xend = 1.90, y = 360, yend = 360), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.81, y = 364, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.91, xend = 2.09, y = 360, yend = 360), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.0, y = 364, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 2.10, xend = 2.28, y = 360, yend = 360), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.19, y = 364, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.72, xend = 2.09, y = 372, yend = 372), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.9, y = 376, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.91, xend = 2.28, y = 384, yend = 384), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.09, y = 388, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.72, xend = 2.27, y = 396, yend = 396), color = \"black\") +  # Not Harmattan \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = 400, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1, xend = 2, y = 590, yend = 590), color = \"black\") +  # Harmattan vs Not Harmattan\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.5, y = 600, label = \"***\") +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Higher Ambient PM 2.5 Concentrations During Cooking Periods Persist Across Season\",\n    caption =\"Comparisons and their significance are denoted by the horizontal lines: \\n* indicates p <0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, and *** indicates p < 0.001\") +\n  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 13), # Increase axis text size\n    axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.7), # Increase tick mark size\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), # Increase legend text size\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 14), # Increase legend title size\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 13),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/boxplot plot-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe boxplots above further examine the relationship between seasonal Harmattan, peak cooking times, and air pollution. For this analysis, Harmattan was defined from December 1st to March 1st, morning cooking hours between 5–9am, and evening cooking hours between 4–8pm, based on our research partners’ local knowledge of the region. As a comparison to the cooking hours, I looked at a control hour (3am) in the middle of the night as it should be completely unaffected by human behavior, as well as a group of ‘other hours’ that excluded the cooking hours and the control hour, leaving me with a total of 4 groups.\n\nI utilized ANOVAs to test for differences in the time groupings for the entire data, and then for each season separately. The results were highly significant for each test, so I moved forward with Tukey’s HSD to further examine the differences in means for each group. Partially due to the large number of observations in the data (and thus small standard deviations), all differences between groups were highly significant.\n\nRegarding seasonality, as expected, PM 2.5 concentration was higher (M = 84, SD = 60) on average during Harmattan months than non-Harmattan months (M = 26, SD = 24). During the Harmattan, evening cooking hours (M = 131, SD = 77) were associated with the highest pollution levels, followed by morning cooking hours (M = 95, SD = 64), with other hours (M = 74, SD = 48) and the control hour (M = 70, SD = 45) experiencing lower levels. The same order held outside of Harmattan, with evening cooking hours (M = 47, SD = 34) associated with the highest PM 2.5 concentration, then morning cooking hours (M = 25, SD = 19), then other hours (M = 21, SD = 19), and finally the control hour (M = 16, SD = 13).\n\n### Spatial Variability\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# DURING HARMATTAN ----\n\n#PM 2.5\npm25_summary_harmattan <- pm25_corrected %>%\n  filter(date >= harmattan_start & date < harmattan_end) %>%\n  group_by(monitor) %>%\n  summarise(mean_pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE),\n            median_pm25 = median(pm25, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  right_join(monitor_points)\n\n\nharmattan_spatial_plot <- ggplot() +\n  # Add Ghana regions within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = regions, fill = ifelse(regions$region == \"Bono East\", \"#f5e493\", \"#dadbe0\"), color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5)  +\n  \n  # Add road data\n  geom_sf(data = roads_filtered, color = \"gray\", size = 0.3) +  # Add roads data\n  \n  # Add monitor points with transparency within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = pm25_summary_harmattan, aes(geometry = geometry, color = mean_pm25), alpha = 0.7, size = 6) +\n\n  # Zoom in to the bounding box\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-2.2, -1.3), ylim = c(7.6, 8.8), expand = FALSE) +\n  \n  # Customize\n  labs(title = \"Mean PM 2.5 for Each Monitor During Harmattan\",\n       x = \"\", \n       y = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"#0540a1\", high = \"#eb4c2d\",\n                       breaks = c(min(pm25_summary_harmattan$mean_pm25), 85, 110, max(pm25_summary_harmattan$mean_pm25)),\n                       labels = c(paste(round(min(pm25_summary_harmattan$mean_pm25),0)), \"85\", \"110\", paste(round(max(pm25_summary_harmattan$mean_pm25),0))),\n                       name = \"PM 2.5 \\n(µg/m³)\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11), # Increase axis text size\n    axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.7), # Increase tick mark size\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14), # Increase plot title size\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), # Increase legend text size\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12), # Increase legend title size\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.3, \"lines\") # Increase legend tick mark size\n  )\n\n\n# OUTSIDE OF HARMATTAN ----\n\npm25_summary_not_harmattan <- pm25_corrected %>%\n  filter(date < harmattan_start | date >= harmattan_end) %>%\n  group_by(monitor) %>%\n  summarise(mean_pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE),\n            median_pm25 = median(pm25, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  right_join(monitor_points)\n\nnot_harmattan_spatial_plot <- ggplot() +\n  # Add Ghana regions within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = regions, fill = ifelse(regions$region == \"Bono East\", \"#f5e493\", \"#dadbe0\"), color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5)  +\n  \n  # Add road data\n  geom_sf(data = roads_filtered, color = \"gray\", size = 0.3) +  # Add roads data\n  \n  # Add monitor points with transparency within the bounding box\n  geom_sf(data = pm25_summary_not_harmattan, aes(geometry = geometry, color = mean_pm25), alpha = 0.7, size = 6) +\n\n  # Zoom in to the bounding box\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-2.2, -1.3), ylim = c(7.6, 8.8), expand = FALSE) +\n  \n  # Customize\n  labs(title = \"Mean PM 2.5 for Each Monitor Outside of Harmattan\",\n       x = \"\", \n       y = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_color_gradient2(low = \"#0540a1\", mid = \"#eb4c2d\", high = \"goldenrod\", \n                        midpoint = 55,  # Set the midpoint value\n                        breaks = c(min(pm25_summary_not_harmattan$mean_pm25, na.rm = TRUE),35, 55, max(pm25_summary_not_harmattan$mean_pm25)),\n                        labels = c(paste(round(min(pm25_summary_not_harmattan$mean_pm25),0)),\"35\", \"55\", paste(round(max(pm25_summary_not_harmattan$mean_pm25),0))),\n                        name = \"PM 2.5 \\n(µg/m³)\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11), # Increase axis text size\n    axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.7), # Increase tick mark size\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14), # Increase plot title size\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), # Increase legend text size\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12), # Increase legend title size\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.3, \"lines\") # Increase legend tick mark size\n  )\n\n# Create a joint title\ntitle <- textGrob(\"Maps of Pollution Levels for PM 2.5 Show Spatial Variability in the Monitors.\", gp = gpar(fontsize = 20))\n\n# Arrange plots with title\ngrid.arrange(\n  arrangeGrob(harmattan_spatial_plot, not_harmattan_spatial_plot, ncol = 2),  # Arrange plots\n  top = title  # Add title at the top\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe maps above display the mean PM 2.5 levels for each monitor in the study area. The plots show that PM concentrations vary across the region, with certain monitors recording higher mean pollutant levels. These spatial patterns suggest that local environmental factors and/or human activities may influence pollution levels, leading to the observed variations in PM concentrations.\n\nWhile there is variation in pollution levels across the communities, I used Moran’s I test to look for spatial correlation and found no evidence that the variation can be explained by the location alone. I also tried running regressions to see if proximity to road, type of road, and population of the community could explain the variation, but found no evidence of an association with any of these predictors.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThese results underscore the significant day-to-day and seasonal fluctuations in air quality across Ghana’s Bono East region, particularly during the Harmattan months and around cooking hours. They point to an urgent need for both seasonal and local interventions—whether through cleaner fuels, improved ventilation, or other strategies—to reduce PM 2.5 exposure.\n\nBuilding on these insights, my ongoing research at Columbia focuses on supporting communities as they transition from charcoal to cleaner-burning LPG, which holds promise for substantially lowering pollution and improving maternal and child health outcomes. This evidence strengthens the case for adopting cleaner cooking practices and highlights the value of continued monitoring to guide effective, data-driven solutions.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\]: Quinn, A.
