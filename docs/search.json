    "text": "Lewis is now pursuing a Master's Degree in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. Growing up with Scottish parents, Lewis spent many summers on the west coast of Scotland where he developed a keen interest in the natural world, spending many hours exploring and understanding life in the tide pools. A watercolor enthusiast, Lewis is drawn toward data visualization because of its ability to communicate important information in an engaging way. Upon completion of this master's program, Lewis hopes to use data modeling, data visualization, and scientific communication skills to tackle aspects of the many problems that climate change is bringing to our world. He is particularly interested in extreme weather events and the effect of climate change on human health."
