In this podcast, Elke Windschitl and I discuss the ethics of using behavioral nudging tactics and artificial intelligence to help tackle climate issues. Positions were assigned at random. Elke argued in favor of using AI but against using nudging tactics while I argued the opposing positions.

This podcast was created as a final project for *EDS 242: Ethics and Bias in Environmental Data Science,* an ethics course in UCSB's Master's of Environmental Data Science curriculum taught by Dena Montague.

Intro music was created by [Bonfire Records](https://bonfirerecords.com/) and moderation was conducted by Jessica French.
